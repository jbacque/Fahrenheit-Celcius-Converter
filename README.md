# Fahrenheit-Celcius-Converter
A Javascript program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius

A fairly simple assignment to start coding with Javascript.

Some extensions if you are finished:

- Have a button to switch between converting F > C and C > F.
- Change the background colour of the page to represent how "hot" the temperature calculated is:
   - E.g. Background color of red for temperatures above 90F, orange for between 70-90F, yellow for 50-70F, etc....
- Add an option to convert to Kelvin (look up the formula online)
